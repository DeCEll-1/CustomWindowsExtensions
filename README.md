The "snooze guard" extension launches the right-clicked executable with one of the following effects:
- prevent display from turning off
- prevent system from going to sleep
- prevent system from going to sleep and display from turning off

Useful for when you just want to run something (that windows can "break" by going to sleep) without
worrying whether that will happen or not.

Whatever the reason, this one can run executables with one of these three effects.

# Command Prompt

Only valid when right-clicking in an empty space in any folder.

Just opens the command prompt in that folder, as admin, and will ask for UAC elevation
